## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- SASS styling
- TypeScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Developing this project, I learned how to set up React context and how to create custom hooks. Here I created useDraggable hook that allows to move an element by mouse or touch move. I also learned more about working with TypeScript in React.

### Continued development

In my next projects, I want to deepen my understanding of intermediate and advanced concepts in React and TypeScript.
